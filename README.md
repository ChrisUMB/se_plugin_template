# Source Engine Plugin Template

This is meant to be a bare-bones plugin to be used as a copy/paste template for making new plugins. It includes MinHook
simply because most interesting plugin ideas will most likely require a decent chunk of hooking.

## Setup

1. Clone Repository using Git
2. Clone [CMake SE2007](https://github.com/ChrisUMB/source_engine_2007/tree/msvc-v143-cxx17) into the `/lib` folder (or symlink it from somewhere else)
